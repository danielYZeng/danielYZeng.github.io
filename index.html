            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="selfie.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
            <p class="rowdies-bold">Hello! My name is Daniel Zeng, a rising senior at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor of 
                Science in Data Science. I am passionate about leveraging data to make life more convenient for people by providing 
                valuable insights to colleagues who can collaborate with me to make real change. I was fortunate to participate in a 
                formative experienceâ€”studying abroad during my first year of university in the Global Scholars Program. Learning to 
                live in the Bay Area and Europe generally not only broadened my cultural perspective but also honed my rapid 
                adaptability and effective communication skills.</p>

            <p class="rowdies-bold">I have taken coursework that allowed me to work with all things data, whether that be databases, 
                data analysis, and machine learning in Python and SQL. Currently I am also learning web development and data 
                visualization using various Python libraries including altair, Javascript, and HTML. I became heavily interested in 
                transportation during my time in the Bay Area but more specifically Europe due to the efficient systems on that 
                continent. In the long run, I hope to use my skills to enhance logistics of perhaps the supply chain using data 
                analysis or machine learning. My other main interest is the food industry. I have learned of the deception in this 
                industry, and I hope to maybe also incorporate this into my life.</p>
